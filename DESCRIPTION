Title: An package for identification of novel peptides by customized
        database derived from RNA-Seq
Description: This package provides functions for construction of
        customized protein databases based on RNA-Seq data, database
        searching, post-processing and report generation. This kind of
        customized protein database includes both the reference
        database (such as Refseq or ENSEMBL) and the novel peptide
        sequences form RNA-Seq data.
